# `0x02. vi` `Shell` `Editor`
 
## Another text editor
After `Emacs`, it’s time to play with `Vi`.

## Resources
### Read or watch:

- [Basic vi Commands](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/xCkhzajLX2pF5Sk7fFs0hQ)

## Learning Objectives
- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/jWCeSMEQ0zVBUN9gKgQTWA), without the help of Google:

## General
- What is vi
- Who is Bill Joy
- How to start and exit vi
- What are the command and insert modes, and how to switch from one to the other
- How to edit text
- How to cut and paste lines
- How to search forward and backward
- How to undo
- How to quit vi

## Requirements
- All tasks must be done inside the sandbox `Ubuntu 20.04`
- Your sandbox must be available at the end of this project - the Checker will access to it just after the deadline to run the correction!
- The answer of a task must be in a specific file
- Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to quit without saving changes?” -> the file should contain only `:q!`
