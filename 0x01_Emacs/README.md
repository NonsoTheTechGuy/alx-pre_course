# `Project - 0x01. Emacs` `Shell` `Editor`
  
## Concepts
- For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- [The Framework](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559)
- [Shell](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/9)
- [Using Emacs as editor](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/54)

## Congrats!
Now you know how to navigate into a Unix system!

It’s time to test and decide what will be your favorite text editor on your sandbox: `Emacs` or `Vi`.

During this project you will play with Emacs.

## Resources
### Read or watch:

- [A Guided Tour of Emacs](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/DdHY8IFvykhK9KOLKTPLVg)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/yaKx7FQ4pX3dlx7SNbAStg), without the help of Google:

## General
- What is Emacs
- Who is Richard Stallman
- How to open and save files
- What is a buffer and how to switch from one to the other
- How to use the mark and the point to set the region
- How to cut and paste lines and regions
- How to search forward and backward
- How to invoke commands by name
- How to undo
- How to cancel half-entered commands
- How to quit Emacs
 
## Requirements
- All tasks must be done inside the sandbox `Ubuntu 20.04`
- Your sandbox must be available at the end of this project - the Checker will access to it at midnight for running the correction!
- The answer of a task must be in a specific file
- Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to write buffer to a specified file?” -> the file should contain only `C-x C-w`
